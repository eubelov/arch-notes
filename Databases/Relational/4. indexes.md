# Indexes

An index is a data structure — typically a _B-tree_ or a _Log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree)_ — that allows for faster read queries.

## Tips

- Order of columns matters
- Columns with high degree of uniqueness should be put first

## B-tree
A B-tree is a self-balancing tree that stores sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions and deletions in _logarithmic time_

## LSM tree
LSM tree maintains two or more separate structures; data is synchronized between the structures in batches. For example, one tree-like structure may reside entirely in memory. If insertions cause the in-memory structure to exceed a certain size, a segment from the in-memory structure is merged into the on-disk structure.

## PostgreSQL vs MySQL

In PostgreSQL, each index point directly to the table
In MySQL, an index points to the primary key which points to the table
