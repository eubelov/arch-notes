# Sharding

Sharding is a process of the horizontal scaling of a relational database. With sharding, the data is spread across multiple computers. 

Very large tables can be either _vertically_ or _horizontally_ sharded.

## Partitioning

Partitioning is about grouping subsets of data within a single database instance.

## Advantages

- Handle large Reads and writes
- Increase overall storage capacity 
- Higher availability

# Disadvantages

- Operationally complex
- Cross-shard queries expensive
