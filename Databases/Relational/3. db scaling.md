# Scaling databases

## Partitioning

Partitioning is about grouping subsets of data within a single database instance. A table is partitioned based on a _Partition Key_. When a partitioned table is queried,
only the sub-table that matches the partition key is involved, which yields higher performance.

## Data replication

For read-heavy scenarios, additional read replicas are introduced which are kept in sync with the _master_. Reads are then load balanced across the replicas.

For write-heavy scenarios, _two-way replication_ with geographically distributed masters can be used. Keep in mind that conflicts can occur.

## Sharding

Should be a last resort if nothing else works.
Sharding is a process of the horizontal scaling of a relational database. With sharding, the data is spread across multiple computers. 
Very large tables can be either _vertically_ or _horizontally_ sharded.
With sharding, ACID transactions are not supported.

### Advantages

- Handle large Reads and writes
- Increase overall storage capacity 
- Higher availability

## Disadvantages

- Operationally complex
- Cross-shard queries expensive
- ACID transactions are not supported
- Re-sharding is hard
