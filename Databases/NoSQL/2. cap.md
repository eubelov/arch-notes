# CAP Theorem

In a distributed system, we must select between _Availability_ or _Consistency_.

## CAP and databases

- MongoDB - a CP database since it is a _single-master_ system. One primary node receives all writes.
- Cassandra - an AP database since it has a _masterless_ architecture. Writes and reads can be performed on any node.
