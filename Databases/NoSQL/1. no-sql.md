# NoSQL Databases

This kind of databases typically has a limited form of transactions and less general querying capabilities. This allows NoSQL databases to be easily scaled-out since they are not required to be consistent at all times.

## BASE

- Basically available - ensures the availability of data by replicating it across the nodes
- Soft state - without consistency guarantees, we only have a probability of knowing the state after some amount of time. The onus is on developers deal with this.
- Eventual consistency - after some amount of time, we can know the state of the system. Any further read will return the same data.


## Benefits

- Rich data model
- Greater scalability & performance
- Good choice for CQRS because it only uses simple transactions and executes a fixed set of queries
