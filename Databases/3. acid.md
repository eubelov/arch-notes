# ACID

- Atomicity - guarantee that each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds of fails completely.
- Consistency - transaction can bring the DB from one consistent state to another, preserving invariants.
- Isolation - ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.
- Durability - guarantees that if committed, a transaction will remain committed even in the case of a system failure.
