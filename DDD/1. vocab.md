# DDD Vocabulary

## Aggregate
Is a combination of several _Entities_ and _Value Objects_. Aggregates ensure that its entities are always in a valid state (preserves invariants). An aggregate is a _consistency boundary_.

### Aggregate Rules
- References other aggregates by IDs
- An aggregate is a transactional boundary - all changes are committed or rolled back as a whole
- Changes to an aggregate are done via the root

## Modeling
Process of breaking a domain in such a way that everything is either an Aggregate, Entity or Value Object.

## Entity
Entity - object that has an ID and is mutable. Entities are equal if their IDs are equal.

## Value object
Value object - does not have and ID and is immutable. For value object to be equal, all their values must be the same.
