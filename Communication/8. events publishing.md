# Publishing Events

Often the application needs to publish events in response to changes to the domain model. It is possible that the application crashes after updating the DB but before sending an event to the message broker. One possible solution is the _outbox pattern_ which uses a table as a temporary message queue.

## Outbox Pattern

For this pattern to work, the event's data is first written to a dedicated DB table as part of a transaction that modifies the domain model. Atomicity is guaranteed because this is a local ACID transaction. Then a separate component periodically polls the table and publishes unpublished events to the message broker. A disadvantage of polling is that is is relatively slow and should be performed quite often, which may result in decreased DB performance.

> For .NET implementation of the pattern, see [CAP](https://github.com/dotnetcore/CAP)

For NoSQL databases, unpublished events are stored as an attribute of the entity being modified.

> The challenge is to find entities with unpublished events

## Transactional Log Tailing

A more sophisticated approach is to _tail_ the DB transaction log (log mining)
