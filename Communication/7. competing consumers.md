# Competing Consumers

Competing consumers subscribe to the same messages source and process messages concurrently. This increases performance of the application, however the concurrent processing has some challenges.

## Out-of-order Messages

Sharded channels can be used to overcome the problem of out-of-order messages.

The broker creates a sharded channel of at least 2 shards. A message must define a shard key which is used by the broker to select a shard for the message. Messages with the same key will always be processed by the same shard. The message broker then groups receivers and assigns each group a shard.

## Duplicated messages

Message brokers often guarantee _at least one delivery_. During normal operation of the message broker, each message will be delivered only once, however when the broker crashes or restarts, a duplicated message can be sent. The application's logic must take this fact into account and be designed in a way to be able to detect and deal with duplicates.

One solution is to make receivers _idempotent_

Another solution is to track IDs of processed messages in the database. In case of relational DBs, the message ID can be stored in a dedicated tables as part of a transaction. In NoSQL databases with limited transactional support, IDs of processed messages can be stored inside the business object that is a subject of the event.
