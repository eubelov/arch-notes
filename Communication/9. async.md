# Asynchronous Interaction

This style of interaction increases resiliency since parties may be unavailable for a period of time without affecting the result of the operation.
It is recommended that services interact via messaging where possible.


## Data Replication

Data replication is a mechanism whereby services subscribe to domain events of other services and store a copy of data in their own storage. This eliminates the need for communication between services.

## Saga

If an operation may take long time to complete, it is recommended to try braking it into separate async steps, and return an incomplete result to the client. The client then polls the service for updates.
