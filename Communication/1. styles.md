## APIs

Service's API is a contract between the service and its clients. It includes operations which clients can invoke and events which are published by the service.
It is recommended to design public APIs upfront, using an _Interface Definition Language_

## APIs Versioning

To avoid breaking changes, services and their consumers must follow the [Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)

> ... be contravariant in the input type and covariant in the output type

> Covariance is the quality of being different by being more specific (Cat is covariant to Animal) while contravariance is the quality of being different by being more general (Animal is contravariant to Cat).

When breaking changes are introduces, a new version of an API must be created. The old version must be maintained for a while, until its consumers have switched to a new version.
