# Message Broker

A message broker is an intermediary through which services communicate. The sender does not need to know the network location of the consumer. A message broker buffers messages until the consumer is able to process them.

| Message broker | Point-to-point channel | Publish-subscribe channel                |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Apache Kafka   | Topic                  | Topic                                    |
| AMQP brokers   | Exchange + Queue       | Fanout exchange and a queue per consumer |
| AWS Kinesis    | Stream                 | Stream                                   |
| AWS SQS        | Queue                  | â€”                                        |

## Benefits
- Loose coupling 
- Does not require service discovery
- Message buffering

## Drawbacks
- Brokers can become performance bottlenecks
- Potential single point of failure
- Operational complexity
