# REST
REST is an IPC mechanism that uses HTTP. The key component is a _resource_ which often represents a business object.
REST allows to manipulate the resource with HTTP verbs.

[Richardson Maturity Model](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)

- Level 0 - single POST endpoint. Request specifies the action to perform and the target of the action
- Level 1 - supports the idea of resources. A client makes a POST request that specifies the action to perform and parameters
- Level 2 - HTTP verbs are used to perform actions. Enables services to use web infrastructure such as caching
- Level 3 - HATEOAS
 
## Idempotence

It is a property of an operation to be executed multiple times without affecting an internal state of the resource.

- GET, PUT - idempotent
- POST, DELETE - non-idempotent

## Benefits

- Widely used and supported by almost all devices and browsers
- Firewall-friendly
- Does not require an intermediate broker

## Drawbacks

- How to fetch multiple resources in a single request?
- How to map multiple operations to HTTP verbs? (e.g. cancel order, update price, update delivery status etc)
- Both client and server must be online (no intermediate buffer)
- Requires a service discovery mechanism since services must know network locations of each other
