# Messaging

Messaging is an asynchronous communication style between services. Most often, _message broker_ is used which can store and route messages.

## Message Channels
Messages are sent over channels. There are two kinds of channels:
- Point-to-point
- Pub-sub

Typically, a message has a header and a body. A header is a key-value collection of metadata, and the body contains a payload.
The header can contain a correlation ID, message ID as well as a _reply channel_ where the response is expected to be sent.

## Message Kinds

- Command - invokes an operation
- Event - indicates that an event happened in the system. Does not require a reply
- Document - used for data propagation
