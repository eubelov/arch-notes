# GraphQL

GraphQL defines a single entry point into the system and enables clients to specify, using a graph-based query language, exactly what data they want to be returned.
This eliminates the need for an _API Gateway_ or _BFF_.

## Components
- **Schema** describes data model
- **Resolvers** map Schema to services 

## Considerations
- Batching
- Caching
