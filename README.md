# Architecture Notes

This repo contains notes about different aspect of software engineering and architecture as well as a list of amazing books that have had a tremendous impact on me as an engineer. I will add more notes as I learn more. These notes are intended primarily for myself, however you might find them useful too. And if you do, give this repo a ‚≠ê

Cheers!
